\section*{Introduction}
  This lab introduced us to the embedded development tools we can use to program the myRIO. We briefly went through the setup and deployment of a hello world app using the Microblaze processor in Xilinx SDK, using the myRIO processor using Eclipse, and using the myRIO processor using LabVIEW.
\section*{Analysis}
  \subsection*{3.1 Connect to and Configure myRIO}
    To setup and configure the myRIO was straightforward and had plenty of screenshots and documentation. This made the configuration very easy.
  \subsection*{3.2 Program MicroBlaze from Xilinx SDK}
    Using the Xilinx SDK was mostly straightforward. It was a little unclear that we had to unplug the usb cable from the myRIO and plug it into the JTAG. Besides that we didn't run into any troubles.
  \subsection*{3.3 Program the myRIO Processor from Eclipse}
  \subsection*{3.4 Program the myRIO Processor from LabVIEW}
\section*{Conclusion}
