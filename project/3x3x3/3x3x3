----------------- Materials ---------------------------
27 LEDs
Protoboard
Atmel AVR Atmega 16
2 optional status LEDs
Max232 rs-232 chip (Looks like a serial transmitter?)
9x 100-400 Ohm resistors for LEDs
2x 470 Ohm resistors for status LEDs
1x 10k resistor
3x 2.2k resistor
3x NPN transistor BC388 (or 250 mA capable)
1x 10uF cap
1x 1000uF cap
6x .1uF ceramic cap
2x 22pF ceramic cap
1x crystal 14.7456 MHz
2x tactile button
Optional power switch
12v Power connector
Optional 5v connector



Notes: The serial transmitter, Atmega16, and crystal can all probably be replaced
with a microcontroller, along with most other things (see "The controller")

----------------- Build -----------------------
Split the cube into 3 layers of 3x3 (3 horizontal 3x3 squares)
LEDs in column shares common anode (+)
LEDs in horizontal layer shares common cathode(-)

Only light _one_ layer at a time!

Follow instructions (linked above) to build the cube

----------------- Resistors ------------------
Keep in mind max source current of microcontroller!
Also max current LEDs can accept!

Choose resistors based on above

----------------- The controller -------------------
As far as I can tell, aside from the resistors for the LEDs, most of the eletronics
are for building our own controller. We don't need these if we're using our own controller.
The caps, extra resistors, status LEDs, etc. Not necessary. We only need the 9x 100-400 Ohm resistors (for the anodes)
and the 3x 2.2k resistors for the cathodes. The cathodes also get the transistors attached.
More GPIO pins drive the transistor gates (Is this safe?)
