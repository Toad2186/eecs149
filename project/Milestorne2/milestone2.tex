  \section{Introduction}
    Our project is to create an 8 x 8 x 8 LED chandelier that is interactive. We completed a prototype of a strand. It is fully functional and more or less up to specification. Our next step is to start going into production mode and try to make as many strands as we can. Our main limitations are time. Initially we were considering making 64 individual strands, but now we think it is more realistic to create 16.
