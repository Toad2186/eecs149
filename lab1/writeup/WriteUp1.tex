\section*{Analysis}
  \subsection*{2 Pair a desktop computer with the WiiMote}
    \subsubsection*{a What is the MAC address of your WiiMote?}
      Something goes here.
  \subsection*{3 Plot the uncalibrated accelerometer signal from the WiiMote} 
    \subsubsection*{a What are the values of the x and y axes when the WiiMote is at rest on level ground?}
      Something goes here.
    \subsubsection*{b What is the value of the z axis when the WiiMote is at rest on level ground? What quantity is begin measured?}
      Something goes here.
  \subsection*{4 Control the WiiMote actuators}
    \subsubsection*{a What is the Report ID and Payload to turn WiiMote LEDs 2 and 4 on, and LEDs 1 and 3 off?}
      Something goes here.
    \subsubsection*{b How can you modify the above sequence to also enable the rumble motor?}
      Something goes here.
  \subsection*{5 Measure sensitivity and bias of the accelerometer}
    \subsubsection*{a Where are these measurements stored?}
      Something goes here.
    \subsubsection*{b What bias did you record?}
      Something goes here.
    \subsubsection*{c What sensitivity did you record?}
      Something goes here.
    \subsubsection*{d Provide screenshots of changes to the block diagram code}

  \subsection*{6 Calibrate the accelerometer}
    \subsubsection*{a What equations did you use to calibrate the accelerometer and to calculate the magnitude of the acceleration it measures?}
      Something goes here.
    \subsubsection*{b Based on your calibration parameters and the number of bits of resolution of the WiiMote ADC, and an affine model of the WiiMote accelerometer, what is your estimate of teh maximum acceleration that the WiiMote can measure?}
      Something goes here.
    \subsubsection*{c When the WiiMote is at rest, what should be the value of the magnitude indicator?}
      Something goes here.
    \subsubsection*{d Why is it better to perform calibration at runtime, rather than hard-coding values for the sensitivity and bias of the sensor?}
      Something goes here.
    \subsubsection*{e Provide the relevant MathScript code and screenshots of changes (if any) to the block diagram}
      Something goes here.
  \subsection*{7 Measure Pitch and Roll}
    \subsubsection*{a What equations did you use to calculate pitch and roll?}
      Something goes here.
    \subsubsection*{b Provide the relevant MathScript code and screenshots of changes (if any) to the block diagram.}
      Something goes here.
  \subsection*{8 Filter the accelerometer signal}
    \subsubsection*{a Describe your filter, and include an equation for its impulse response, frequency response, or its output as a fraction of input.}
      Something goes here.
    \subsubsection*{b Provide the relevant MathScript codd and screenshots of changes (if any) to the block diagram}
